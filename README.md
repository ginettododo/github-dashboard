# RepoRadar

RepoRadar is a desktop app that scans a local root folder for Git repositories and shows actionable Git health in one view.

## What users can do
- Pick a root folder and scan all nested repos.
- See each repo's branch, dirty state, ahead/behind counts, and status badges.
- Run **Fetch**, **Pull (rebase)**, and **Push** safely per-repo.
- Run **Refresh all** (fetch + status refresh only; never pull/push).
- Copy a text report for all visible repos.

## Install / Run

### Windows (recommended for non-developers)
1. Download the latest Windows installer from the `release/` folder:
   - `RepoRadar Setup <version>.exe` (NSIS installer), or
   - `RepoRadar <version>.exe` (portable).
2. Run the installer (or portable exe).
3. Launch RepoRadar from Start Menu (or by opening the portable exe).

### macOS
1. Download from `release/`:
   - `RepoRadar-<version>-mac.zip` (generated by default build script), and optionally
   - `RepoRadar-<version>.dmg` if you enable DMG target on a macOS packaging host.
2. Unzip and move **RepoRadar.app** into **Applications**.
3. First launch: if Gatekeeper warns, right-click the app > **Open** once.

> Current build config is ready for packaging, but signing/notarization is **not enabled by default**. Unsigned builds may require manual “Open Anyway” steps on macOS.

## First run flow
1. Open RepoRadar.
2. Click **Select Root Folder**.
3. Choose your parent projects directory (for example `~/Code` or `C:\Projects`).
4. RepoRadar starts scanning immediately and shows progress.

## GitHub authentication recommendations
RepoRadar uses your system Git credentials.

Recommended options:
- **SSH keys** (most stable for desktop workflows).
- **GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`)** if you prefer HTTPS with managed auth.

## Troubleshooting

### Git missing / not in PATH
- RepoRadar shows a blocking banner.
- Install Git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Restart RepoRadar.

### Authentication failure
- Symptoms: fetch/pull/push fails with auth hint.
- Fix: refresh credentials using SSH keys or `gh auth login`.

### Diverged branch
- RepoRadar blocks pull-rebase when branch is diverged.
- Resolve manually in terminal (rebase/merge), then refresh.

### Dirty repo
- RepoRadar blocks pull-rebase when working tree has uncommitted changes.
- Commit/stash/discard changes, then retry.

### NO ACCESS badge
- Repo folder could not be read due to OS permissions.
- Re-select root folder and grant access, or fix folder permissions.

## Build commands
From repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build:win
npm run build:mac
npm run build:all
```

Artifacts are emitted to `release/`.

Expected filenames (platform-specific naming may include architecture/build metadata):
- Windows NSIS installer: `RepoRadar Setup <version>.exe`
- Windows portable: `RepoRadar <version>.exe`
- macOS zip: `RepoRadar-<version>-mac.zip`
- macOS disk image (optional if enabled): `RepoRadar-<version>.dmg`
